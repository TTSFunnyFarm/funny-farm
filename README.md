# Toontown's Funny Farm
The first ever single-player adaptation of Disney's Toontown Online, with a twist!

## Requirements before playing
- Panda3D 1.11.0 (w/ Python 3.6.8)
  - Normally you can get the latest development builds of Panda3D from [this page](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?version=devel&sdk). However, since they don't have any builds available right now, John built an SDK for us:
    - [Panda3D 1.11.0 (32-bit)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vHQ8VMCQnPdz5evQWOJeoR8taFpX5HDR)
    - [Panda3D 1.11.0 (64-bit)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZQI8WWfEnbTfjsAYUyin79u8cCWADENu)
  - Either 32-bit or 64-bit will work for development--the game will be supporting both, so take your pick.
- Install anything in requirements.txt by running this command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Other notes
Future ideas for Toontown's Funny Farm can be added to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjD-nQv7TKbvCNu1u9vBIYbtWmVptw5vZ0W8_gaN5pI/edit?usp=sharing). Our project is malleable, and though we've established a general vision and direction for the game, we love to hear everyone's input.
