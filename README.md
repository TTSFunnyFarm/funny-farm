# Toontown's Funny Farm
The first ever single-player adaptation of Disney's Toontown Online, with a twist!

## Requirements before playing
- Panda3D SDK
  - Grab the latest Panda3D SDK from [here](https://www.panda3d.org/download/).
  - (Windows users) We currently use Python 3.7, so if the SDK installer gives you the option to choose the Python version, select Python 3.7
  - Either 32-bit or 64-bit will work for development -- the game will be supporting both, so take your pick.
- Install anything in requirements.txt by running this command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Other notes
- Aside from bugfixes and/or code cleanup, all commits to the master branch should be reviewed/approved by either Patrick or John before being pushed. The master branch should ALWAYS be stable. If you're tasked with developing a LARGE, NEW game feature, a new branch should be created for it. When the feature is developed and stable enough for the master branch, a pull request should be created, and after review, Patrick or John will either merge or request further changes before merging.

- Future ideas for Toontown's Funny Farm can be added to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjD-nQv7TKbvCNu1u9vBIYbtWmVptw5vZ0W8_gaN5pI/edit?usp=sharing). Our project is malleable, and though we've established a general vision and direction for the game, we love to hear everyone's input.
